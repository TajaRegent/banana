    McLuhan contends that the allure of recorded data lies in our inclination to fill in gaps, with the medium becoming more captivating as data becomes more insufficient. This paradigmatic abstraction, transforms the multi-sensory living world into silent, visual, technical text. However, a tension arises between data as a record or representation and the vastness of the world from which it is abstracted. While data fragments offer a precious trace of the past, they simultaneously tether us to machines, industrial processes, and the electricity grid, isolating us into individuality.
